This contains the code for parallelized multiple linear regression and NaiveBayes developed from scratch using PySpark. The instructions are fairly straightforward
To Run:
spark-submit multiLinearRegression.py /path/to/input/files/on/hdfs
spark-submit NBClassifier.py /path/to/input/files/on/hdfs
This code was run on cloudera since it was a small dataset
