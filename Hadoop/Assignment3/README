I have used cloudera to implement this assignment.

The submission contains 1 .java files. 
-Driver.java

All my other classes are inside it

Instructions to execute the codes (Same as the instructions in the cloudera wordcount tutorial):

mkdir -p build
javac -cp /usr/lib/hadoop/*:/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/* <File_name>.java -d build -Xlint 
jar -cvf <jar_name>.jar -C build/ .
hadoop jar <jar_name>.jar org.myorg.<File_name> /user/cloudera/pagerank/input /user/cloudera/pagerank/output 

Running the one driver class by providing the input path and output path should be everything that needs to be done
